# Navigating Data

We've given you a big old piece of data in this workshop. Your challenge is to navigate it 🧭

Data in the real world can be gnarly at times 🍝, and can feel unmanageable 😰. But, as always, if we break it down and approach it systematically it is completely doable 💪!

## Story

We've launched an alternative to social media apps which we think will blow them all out of the water... Welcome to SOCBook...

SOCBook has a lot of data, and we're going to see how we can interact with and use that data. It's available through the `SOCBook` variable (because in `index.html` we are importing `data.js`, which creates the `SOCBook` variable). Take a look at the tasks, and have a play 🛝

## Files

The files you need to care about for this workshop are:

- `index.html` - this is your HTML file, and won't need editing
- `main.js` - this is where all of your JavaScript will go

## Tasks

The tasks are outlined in `main.js` - complete them as instructed. Remember to use computational thinking always! Especially:

- Understand the problem
- Break down into smaller problems
