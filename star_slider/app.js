/*
Learning Objectives:
  1. Manipulate DOM elements based on user input.
  2. Dynamically create and delete elements based on slider values.
  3. Enhance understanding of event-driven programming.

Brief:
You're provided with a slider (ranging from 1 to 5) and an empty space to populate star icons. Your task is to create or remove stars dynamically based on the value of the slider.

Expected Outcomes:
  1. The number of star icons should match the slider's value.
  2. Adjusting the slider should immediately reflect the change in the number of star icons.
*/

// Place your plan and solution below!

const slider = document.getElementById("starSlider");
const starIcon = document.querySelector("div > span");

slider.addEventListener("input", reprintStars);

function reprintStars() {
   starIcon.textContent = "â˜…".repeat(slider.value);
}
