    <ol>
        <li> Write a function called add7 that takes one number and returns that number + 7. </li>
        <li>Write a function called multiply that takes 2 numbers and returns their product. </li>
        <li>Write a function called capitalize that takes a string and returns that string with only the first letter capitalized.
             Make sure that it can take strings that are lowercase, UPPERCASE or BoTh.</li>
        <li>Write a function called lastLetter that takes a string and returns the very last letter of that string: lastLetter("abcd") should return "d" </li>
    </ol>
